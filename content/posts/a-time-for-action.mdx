Most contemporary organizations have onset adopting digital infrastructure to support their businesses. With the commencement of restrictions COVID-19 has brought, more companies are recognizing the undeniable value that cloud delivers.

Possibly the most incredible thing about cloud technologies is the flexible options they provide; even more now in this time of crisis, when companies need solutions to reduce the outage on their operations during this difficulty. An ample, never-ending network of cloud-based systems enabled organisations to stay up and running throughout this pandemic. The sudden shift to remote work and socialization also wouldn’t be possible without software solutions that enable rapid, secure and consistent deployment of application environments.

AWS and Google cloud have all suffered high profile incidents in the past, with AWS services being interrupt by a DDoS attacks and GCP facing issues with their infrastructure component that have impacted multiple products. Azure has also struggled with a string of well [documented outages](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status/history/).

The sudden increase in home working as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic means pressure on some cloud servers as most personnel must work from home. The capacity in the UK regions was showing signs of stress even before the current crisis, so it is not surprising that issues are occurring now.

It is a reminder that even the best resourced companies are not immune to development and infrastructure disruptions.
