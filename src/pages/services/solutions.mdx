## Cloud Based VOIP Services ##

A VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) system gives you everything a traditional phone system does but with one crucial
difference: it's hosted in the cloud.

And that means you spend less money on hardware and maintenance.

A cloud-based phone system also gives you much more flexibility because you can take and manage calls not just from
your desk phone, but from your computer and mobile. So you can use all of the features of the office system wherever you are.
With VoIP, you'll never miss an important call again.
